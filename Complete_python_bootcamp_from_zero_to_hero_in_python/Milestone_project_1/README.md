who to start first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on 
the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of
